this script uses NetworkX library to generate a random, full N-ary tree of height H.
then it randomly adds edges until the graph has num_vertices * 2 edges.
there are no duplicate edges or loops, and the graph is connected (because it already has a spanning tree by design).

to run it:
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 gen.py <args>
