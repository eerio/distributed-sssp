CC -O3 split.cpp -o split

clone graph500 in this folder:
https://github.com/graph500/graph500.git
in graph500/src, modify Makefile to set correct compiler (for Okeanos, "CC")

copy run_graph500.sh from this folder to graph500/src

then run:

bash run_graph500.sh

make-connected.cpp is to be run in a test which has already been split
(so a valid input to our original problem, folder with files 0.in, 1.in, ...)
run it there with argument X denoting numbre of files

it will create a cycle between all the nodes in the edge files.
