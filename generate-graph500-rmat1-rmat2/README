CC -O3 split.cpp -o split

clone graph500 in this folder:
https://github.com/graph500/graph500.git
in graph500/src, modify Makefile to set correct compiler (for Okeanos, "CC")

copy run_graph500.sh from this folder to graph500/src

then run:
make
bash run_graph500.sh

it's fine when you timeout / oom / interrupt while validating the graph
it's important for it to get created and saved to disk,
validation can be interrupted (it takes a lot of time)

to change from rmat1 to rmat2:
look at run_graph500.sh,
check which file in graph500 src you need to modify to change A, BC, D.
change them both in graph500/generator and in run_graph500.sh
rerun make!
then you can generate graphs again


make-connected.cpp is to be run in a test which has already been split
(so a valid input to our original problem, folder with files 0.in, 1.in, ...)
run it there with argument X denoting numbre of files

it will create a cycle between all the nodes in the edge files.
